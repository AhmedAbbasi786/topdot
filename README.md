
After cloning a React app from a Git repository, you need to follow these steps to run and start the app:

1: Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and navigate to the root directory of the cloned project using the cd command:

cd path/to/cloned/project


2: Once you are inside the project directory, install the project dependencies using:

npm install

This assumes that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can download and install them from the official website: Node.js.

3: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the React development server with:

npm start


This command will compile the React app and launch it in your default web browser. The development server will also watch for changes in your code and automatically reload the app.

4: Your React app should now be running locally. Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:

http://localhost:3000


ENV = 

REACT_APP_BASE_URL= https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products

donot forget to add env variable#
